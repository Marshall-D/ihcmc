        Attendance at a conference such as&nbsp;IHCMC 2023 is considered to be a
        cross-border business activity and therefore you will be considered a
        business visitor.
        <br />
        International delegates attending the IHCMC 2023 who require a visa to
        enter Canada will be issued a <strong>Business Visitor</strong> Visa by
        the Canada High Commission in their home country.

        If you require a visa we strongly advise that after registering for the

        will facilitate your entry into Canada and the processing of visa
        applications. The Special Events Unit of Immigration, Refugee and
        Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canadian Border Services Agency will
        have access to a copy of the format of the letter of invitation. The
        “letter of invitation” will also facilitate the processing of visa
        applications.
