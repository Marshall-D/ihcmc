                                The importance of the team approach to patient
                                care and research will be clear. As a product of
                                interdisciplinary communication and research
                                efforts, care plans will be suggested for
                                various conditions. In this way, a process of
                                continuing quality improvement can be fostered.
                                Such a process, in addition to
                                optimizing&nbsp;patient care practices, should
                                minimize the problems of medical errors and
                                burn-out that can be serious issues for medical
                                professionals. See you at the conference.
